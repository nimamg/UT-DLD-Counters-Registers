# UT-DLD-Counters-Registers
An n-bit counter with 4 functionality modes &amp; many different registers (latches and FlipFlops)

an n-bit counter is constructed by cascading a UCC-bit (Universal Counter Combinational Bit), and using different latches and flipflops to
check the correctness and learn about the functionality of different registers.
